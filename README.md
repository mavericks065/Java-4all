My visitor / Generic object pool were Java programming exercises done in October 2014.

The Queue Challenge is a Java programming done in June 2016. This test had to be done in 4 to 6 hours. It took me more. But I also tried to not spend more than 8/10h.

My Bowling Game is a technical test I had to do in 2 hours. So the design has been made in function. Also it has completely been done in TDD to make sure the exercise was answering to the company's criteria.

These two tests can be improved but they have been done respecting the exercises and constraints described. 

My katas are just the katas I try to do regularly.

Other projects were experimentations done before using these functionalities in real projects.
